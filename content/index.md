# Introduction

**ZwyLib** is a compact plugin-library that originally started as part of various plugins from the [developer's channel](https://t.me/zwyPlugins), and is now available to anyone who might find it useful.

## Getting Started

Any plugin that wants to use ZwyLib's tools must first import it (after installing it via [this post](https://t.me/zwyPlugins/48)):

```python
# __id__, __name__, ...

try:
    import zwylib  # import the library
except (ImportError, ModuleNotFoundError):
    # zwylib not found â€” its tools cannot be used. raise an error
    raise Exception("Cannot run without ZwyLib. Please install it.")

class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    ...  # your plugin logic
```
